# AEP

This repository contains the ** original C++ package** to use the AEP algorithm

The AEP algorithm numerically calculates the distribution function and the Value-at-Risk of the sum of a number of d positive random variables, when the joint distribution H of the vector (X1,...,Xd) is given. 

For any detail on the theory underlying AEP we refer to the paper

Arbenz, P., Embrechts, P., and G. Puccetti (2011). The AEP algorithm for the fast computation of the distribution of the sum of dependent random variables  available at https://doi.org/10.3150/10-BEJ284

Notice that a new **Python** library including an implementation of the AEP algorithm 
has been provided in https://github.com/gpitt71/gemact-code
